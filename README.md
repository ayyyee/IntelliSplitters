# IntelliSplitters Mod for Satisfactory

IntelliSplitters is an extension to, continuation of and eventually replacement for [Auto Splitters](https://github.com/smuething/SatisfactoryAutoSplitters) by smuething.

This mod adds a IntelliSplitter building that supports different output rates for each output and will auto-balance networks of downstream connected IntelliSplitters.

## Acknowledgements

A big thank you to:
- smuething for creating the AutoSplitters Mod!
- mircearoata who helped smuething with the basic setup of making a custom splitter, let him "borrow" the extracted placeholder assets and UI widgets!
